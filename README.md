## QMap Editor 2.0.0

## How to run
**With Electron**

1. Download or Clone the repo
2. Open command prompt and cd to the folder containing package.json ( not the package.json inside the app folder! )
3. Install the dependencies by using the cli

 `npm install`
4. Run the app with electron by using the cli

 `npm start`

 ( That's assuming you're in the package.json directory, if not cd to that directory )


**From prebuild**

Download a [prebuilt](/#Prebuilt) then run the QMapEditor shortcut or .exe in the app folder

## Building
Two Scripts are included to build:

`build-64` and `build-32` will build for Windows 64bit and 32bit

To use, run the cli

`npm run build-64` or `npm run build-32`

( That's assuming you're in the package.json directory, if not cd to that directory )
